# Jdex

Jdex is a JSON file-system database with server and client components.

This database is primarily developed for use in local developer tools. It may
also serve well for any software that is run for individual end-users on their
personal devices, or on their local network for small work-groups.

## Security

This project provides no security code, it's up to developers to secure their
own HTTP and WebSocket server endpoints.
